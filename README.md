# CuisineAsier
I think I will need 6-8 hours, I will do it with non-stops. I will push here with a "Asier" name, not as "master". So I guess all the commits-pushes will be inside "branches"

Notes:
- The other test app I did for other company (I sent you the apk) I was saving the data, I am not going to save it in this app. It would be easier for me, but I think you don´t want that this app save the data.
- As I saw there are a lot of data to show, I am going to try to show a fraction of the data and show more with "Load More" or something like that.
- Probably I won´t have time, but the last step will be able to filter by cameras (FHAZ, NAVCAM, etc.) with an spinner in the toolbar and see in the results only the data taken by the selected camera.

Thanks,
